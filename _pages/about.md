## Snapshot
Drawing on my foundation in data science and public policy, I specialize in development economics, focusing on gendered disparities in labor markets, the socio-economic implications of oral health, and behavioral nuances in financial decision-making.

## My Journey 
Passionate about deepening the understanding of gender gaps in education, oral health, and finance, my journey began as the co-founder of [Project Reach Foundation](https://resolutionproject.org/ventures/project-reach/), which aimed to combat bottlenecks in neonatal immunization in rural India. Today, apart from my research endeavors, I am getting my Ph.D. in Public Policy at the University of Chicago, specializing in Development and Behavioral Economics. My prior education in Data Analytics from Carnegie Mellon University has equipped me to work at the fascinating confluence of machine learning and economics. Currently, I am also a researcher at the World Bank Group, and my past engagements include research projects in gender and transport at the Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) team. 

## Current Research 
1. **Persistence of Origin-Based Social Norms Among Migrants** _with Naira Kalra and Oyebola Okunogbe_. Investigating the enduring influence of origin-based norms on intimate partner violence among migrants, this study unveils the deep-rooted societal norms influencing migrant behaviors, vital for policy interventions.

2. **Effects of Paid Labor Market Exposure on Transition After High School** _with Emma Zhang_. Exploring the transformative impact of early labor exposure on high school students' post-academic trajectories, this research is pivotal in reshaping educational and labor policies, especially for economically marginalized groups.

3. **Gendered Attitudes Towards Financial Risk: Gain Preferences versus Loss Aversion** _with Emma Zhang_. Delving into gender-specific financial behaviors, and emphasizing reactions to potential losses versus gains, the findings help us understand and address gender disparities in financial decision-making landscapes.

4. **Effects of Poor Oral Health on Systemic Health Outcomes** _with Maya Lozinski_. Examining the broader health and socio-economic repercussions of oral health disparities, with potential implications for labor and healthcare policies as well as public awareness.
