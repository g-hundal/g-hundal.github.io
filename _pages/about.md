## Snapshot

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Public Policy at the University of Chicago. My research lies at the intersection of development, behavioral, and labor economics. I study how information, norms, and visible traits shape education and labor-market outcomes in low-income settings.

**I am on the 2025–26 academic job market.**


## From Fieldwork to Frameworks
My journey into development began as an undergraduate in India, where I co-founded the [Project Reach Foundation](https://resolutionproject.org/ventures/project-reach/), a nonprofit that focused on closing immunization gaps for infants. That early exposure to local institutions and the challenges of implementation shape how I design and interpret field experiments today.
Before starting my Ph.D. at the University of Chicago, I trained in data analytics and policy at Carnegie Mellon University, which equipped me to combine econometrics with experimental design. I have also worked with the World Bank’s Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) and Development Research Group (DRG) teams on projects related to transport and gender.
