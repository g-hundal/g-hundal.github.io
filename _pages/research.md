## Ongoing Research 
1. **Persistence of Origin-Based Social Norms Among Migrants** _with Naira Kalra and Oyebola Okunogbe_: Investigating the enduring influence of origin-based norms on intimate partner violence (IPV) among migrant couples in India, this study unveils the deep-rooted norms influencing migrant couples' IPV behaviors, vital for policy interventions. _(Working paper available upon request)_

2. **Effects of Labor Market Exposure on Transition After High School** _with Emma Zhang_: Exploring the transformative impact of early labor exposure on high school students' post-academic trajectories, this research is pivotal in reshaping educational and labor policies, especially for economically marginalized groups.

3. **Gendered Attitudes Towards Financial Risk: Gain Preferences versus Loss Aversion** _with Emma Zhang_: Delving into gender-specific financial behaviors, and emphasizing reactions to potential losses versus gains, the findings help us understand and address gender disparities in financial decision-making landscapes.

4. **Effects of Poor Oral Health on Systemic Health Outcomes**: Examining the broader health and socio-economic repercussions of oral health disparities, with potential implications for labor and healthcare policies as well as public awareness of oral health.

## Past Research 

#### Development Impact Evaluation (DIME), World Bank, Washington, DC:

- **Impact of Safety Technology on Women's Labor Force Participation**: _with Girija Borker (Jul 2019- Jul 2020)_. A randomized controlled trial in India with approximately 6000 participants to determine the efficacy of safety technology while commuting in enhancing labor force participation for women.
  
- **Evaluating Social Costs of Road Traffic Crashes**: _with Th√©ophile Bougna and Peter Taniform (Jul 2018- Jul 2019)_. In this paper, published in *Accident Analysis & Prevention* (Vol. 165, pp. 106282), we reviewed the socio-economic costs associated with road traffic crashes. We compared the willingness-to-pay (WTP) and human capital (HC) methodologies, revealing that WTP-based analyses typically estimate socio-economic costs that are approximately 1% higher as a percentage of GDP than those using the HC approach.

#### Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA:
- **Long-Term Recidivism Rates as a Risk Factor**: _with Alfred Blumstein (Aug 2017- Jul 2018)_. Analyzed long-term recidivism patterns by computing the hazard function from rap sheets data, exploring the racial disparities in arrest.

- **Combatting Illicit Wildlife Trafficking Through Open-Source Data**: _with Jonathan Caulkins (Aug 2017- Jan 2018)_. Led a multidisciplinary team to automate open-source data collection, mapping corruption patterns related to illicit wildlife trafficking. The project culminated in an extensive research report for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), emphasizing the corruption-wildlife trafficking nexus and offering policy recommendations.

- **Racial Disproportionality in US State Prisons**: _assisted Allen J Beck and Alfred Blumstein (Oct 2016- Jul 2017)_. Analyzed racial and ethnic differences in criminal involvement, arrests, sentencing, and time served in US state prisons. The study, published in the *Journal of Quantitative Criminology* (Vol. 34, pp. 853-883), critically assessed racial disproportionality indicators and provided insights into potential discriminatory practices in the criminal justice system. The research utilized self-reported racial identity data and assessed accountability for individual states and regions, contributing significantly to the discourse on racial disparities in the justice system.
