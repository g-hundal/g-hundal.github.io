## Job Market Papers

### **Smile Inequality: Appearance, Perceived Productivity, and Labor Market Access**
Visible signs of poverty shape how others see us, often in ways that policy rarely acknowledges. I study one such sign, oral appearance, and its effect on early hiring in India. While inequality in education and skills is well documented, income also constrains how people present themselves. Poor oral health is common, easily visible, and remediable, yet it can affect how confident, diligent, or trustworthy someone appears. Using two experiments that replicate the first screening stage of hiring, I show that oral appearance creates a distinct, fixable barrier to upward mobility. In a randomized headshot experiment, visibly poor teeth lower perceived confidence and predicted wages by about 9 percent. In a large-scale incentivized resume-rating experiment with more than 700 hiring professionals, the same “bad-teeth” photo reduces the likelihood of being hired by about two-thirds of the effect seen when removing a skill-certificate qualification. The penalty is concentrated in customer-facing roles and shrinks by about 50 percent once employers’ incentivized forecasts of customer and coworker reactions are included, suggesting that discrimination partly reflects anticipated third-party responses rather than only productivity beliefs. Together, these findings show that a treatable health deficit closely correlated with low income can restrict access to better jobs. Policies that aim to expand mobility must therefore look beyond education and training to address appearance-related constraints that poverty itself creates. [Draft coming soon]

### **Learning About Work: Evidence from a Randomized Internship Program in Urban India**  (with Emma Zhang)
Many low-income youth grow up with little exposure to the world of work, leading to misinformed beliefs about education and employment. We study whether short, school-based internships can improve these beliefs and shape school-to-work transitions. Through a randomized program in more than fifty public schools across Delhi, students were offered 80 hours of after-school work experience at neighborhood shops and service firms. Internship participation increased optimism about the returns to higher education and led students to report more realistic expectations about job-search frictions and low-skill earnings. Willingness to pay for a career-guidance book rose by about 6–8 percent, though estimates are imprecise. Effects are driven largely by girls, who constitute 70 percent of the sample and update their beliefs more strongly, consistent with larger initial constraints on exposure. We find no change in educational aspirations or non-cognitive outcomes, indicating that the intervention operated primarily through improved labor-market information rather than changes in ambition. Overall, the results highlight how short and low-cost workplace experiences can narrow information gaps and help align young people’s educational investments with labor-market realities.

## Work in Progress

### **Language of Violence: Persistence of Origin-Based Social Norms Among Migrant Couples** (with Naira Kalra and Oyebola Okunogbe)  
We examine how social norms embedded in place of origin shape intimate partner violence (IPV) among migrant couples in India. Using a novel classification of internal migrants based on mother tongue and language belts in the National Family Health Survey, we link historical IPV rates in origin regions to current experiences of migrant wives. A one percentage point increase in IPV prevalence at origin predicts a 0.4 percentage point rise in current IPV, even after rich controls and fixed effects. Mechanism analyses show that intergenerational beliefs, especially wives’ acceptance of wife-beating formed from parental exposure, mediate the persistence of these norms. The results highlight the stickiness of cultural norms across migration and underscore how deeply rooted origin-based norms continue to shape household violence despite new social and institutional environments.

### **Sibling Socialization and the Formation of Labor-Force Norms in India** (with Emma Zhang)  
We study how sibling gender composition shapes labor market aspirations and job application behavior among low-income youth in India. Using data from public school alumni, we find that girls with older sisters are significantly more likely to apply for jobs, while those with older brothers apply less. These patterns persist even when controlling for parental expectations and socioeconomic background. Same-sex siblings appear to act as role models, whereas opposite-sex siblings reinforce traditional norms. The next phase, a large scale randomized trial with 5,000 students, is testing at scale whether structured information and social-learning interventions can recalibrate these norms within households.

### **Saving with Stocks: Should We Promote Opportunities for Gains or Assuage Worries Around Loss?** (with Emma Zhang)  
We explore how framing and gender interact in financial risk-taking in the US. Two experiments, one measuring preferences over gains and losses under ambiguity, and another randomizing a group-chat intervention, reveal that men and women differ not in preferences over gains but in aversion to losses. Traders exhibit higher sensitivity to gains than non-traders, while messages emphasizing loss avoidance increase willingness to invest among new investors. A larger follow-up will test whether “loss reassurance” or “gain celebration” framings are more effective at promoting stock market participation.

## Projects in Development

### **Aspirations and Inaction Among High-School Students in India** (with Rajdev Brar)  
We are piloting a randomized field experiment in government schools to study how students make high-stakes education choices at the end of Grade 10. The project tests whether encouraging students to actively search for admissions information, rather than passively receiving it, helps them understand available options and choose academic streams that align better with their own aspirations.

### **Visa Vows: Migration, Marriage, and Cultural Remittances in India** (with Mridul Joshi)  
This project asks how female educational migration from Panjab, India to Canada changes marriage-market behavior in sending communities. We combine a lab-in-the-field partner-choice task in IELTS centers with an online audit of matrimonial profiles, randomly varying migration and dowry signals to trace how cross-border mobility reshapes preferences and social status cues.

### **Does Entrepreneurship Curriculum Create Firm Growth or Perpetuate Microenterprises?** (with Emma Zhang)  
We study whether school-based entrepreneurship training helps youth move into productive employment or mainly reproduces small self-employment. In Gujarat, we partner with public schools and local firms that recruit from vocational streams, randomizing whether firms see students’ vocational credentials when evaluating applicants to measure the value of these programs in early labor-market entry.
